    "#### Reminder about the course notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we will make extensive use of Jupyter Notebooks, with Python 3+.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are advised to work on these notebooks after, or in parallel to, consulting other materials of the module, such as the slide deck and book chapters. The notebooks contain examples and exercises that should help you understand and apply the concepts introduced in the rest of materials. You may also use the official Python docs: https://docs.python.org/3/.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not hesitate to be creative when trying out the examples: you can play with the code. You can try variants of the examples and exercises, print values of the variables to understand what is going on at every step, and come up with different solutions to the same exercise and think about relative advantages of each one.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook also contains formative assignments. These are indicated as FA-n, where n is a number id. As explained in the course guide, you have to submit these. **FA-n questions with no answer, whether you are asked to write an explanation, a code snippet, or both, will be considered incomplete**. Therefore, give it your best effort. If your solution does not work or you think it is inadequate, add a comment explaining why you were trying to achieve.\n",
    "\n",
    "To submit the formative assignments, we ask you to upload the filled-in notebook. The notebook you upload should contain *at least* the formative assigments. It's not a problem if you upload the notebook with additional code, like the variants and tests mentioned above. However, to grade your assignments, we will only look at the answers to the requested exercises (those indicated with FA-n), so **make sure you store your answers in the corresponding variables and/or to name your functions as indicated**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optional exercises are, as the name indicates, not mandatory for the formative assignments. These are exercises that suggest you to create an alternative approach, or which propose a longer problem that allows for the integration of earlier concepts in one solution; in general, they present scenarios where you can be more creative. To make the most of the course, it is best to try them out and share your solutions on the Discussion Board, so that your peers can comment on them. You are also encouraged to comment on the exercises of your fellow students. This will help you sharpen your evaluation skills, which is a great asset in programming, as in turn this will help you devise more robust, efficient and maintainable solutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### /!\\ Before submitting your notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Please check it can be ran without errors! You can check this by pressing kernel --> restart and run all before submitting. If it does not run without errors, it is your **responsibility** to fix the problem either by resolving the bug in your code or by commenting it out along with a comment.\n",
